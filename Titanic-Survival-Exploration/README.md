Titanic-Survival-Exploration

Create decision functions that attempt to predict survival outcomes from the 1912 Titanic disaster based on each passenger's features, such as sex, and age. This project starts with a simple algorithm and increases its complexity until we are able to accurately predict the outcomes for at least 80% of the passengers in the provided data. This project will introduces some of the concepts of machine learning as one starts the Nanodegree program
